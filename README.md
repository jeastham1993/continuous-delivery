# Continuous Delivery

A simple .NET Core API to use for testing the concepts and practices described in the Continuous Delivery book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble.

## Testing

To build and test the application locally, run *commit.cmd* from the repository root.

If you would like to run the full suite of acceptance tests, first run a successful build of the commit.cmd then execute *acceptance.cmd*.
